## Project Description

Iteration 3 implements functionality of all functional requirements. This includes:
- User input of how many classes they want to take
- User input of which classes they want to take
- A Scheduler class that creates a schedule out of sections that do not overlap
- An output that lets the user know if there is no possible schedule with the given classes

Iteration 3 of this project implements unit tests of all functional requirements. This includes a tests that:
- Verify if all courses are being displayed correctly
- Verify if the courses entered are valid
- Verify if entered courses are stored correctly
- Verify if the final schedule is displayed correctly, and if not, if the proper error message is displayed

Project Prompt: You are tasked to build a course scheduling system to help students schedule courses for a semester. You will bring into practice all of the techniques we have studied in the first weeks of the semester, while learning some new ones along the way. You will engage in this activity both inside class and outside of class, while working in a team of 3 students. It will be completed in 3 iterations.
